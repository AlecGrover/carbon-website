## Specifications

The Neutral Gray family is dominant in our UI, making use of subtle shifts in value to help organize content into distinct zones. The Core Blue family has been designated as the primary action color across all products and experiences, ensuring our color aesthetic is a part of every interaction. Additional colors are used sparingly and purposefully.
